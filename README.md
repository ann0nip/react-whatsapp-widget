## What is this?

This is a very simple floating WhatsApp button widget. Due to the impact of covid-19 in 2020, most small businesses had to move to an online presence. One of the wey to improve communication with your customers is using a widget like this.

It adds a floating-like button to your site that calls the WhatsApp Chat API.

It will automatically begin a WhatsApp chat to the number you configure and the text the user writes.

All texts are fully customizable and also you can provide an icon/logo.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-whatsapp-widget
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
// This is the way to import an SVG file and then pass it as a props
import { ReactComponent as CompanyIcon } from './assets/crown.svg';

import { WhatsAppWidget } from 'react-whatsapp-widget';
import 'react-whatsapp-widget/dist/index.css';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <WhatsAppWidget CompanyIcon={CompanyIcon} phoneNumber="XXXXXXXXXX" />
    );
};
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Where the `phoneNumber` is a full phone number in international format. Omit any zeroes, brackets, or dashes when adding the phone number in international format.

Example: `541112222222` where 54 is the Argentina internacional code.
